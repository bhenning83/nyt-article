The assignment was to recreate a New York Times article. This was my first true challenge in CSS layout. This is also the project where I discovered my love of flexbox. 

Project is not responsive. That comes later in the curriculum.

Written with CSS and HTML. 

Completed as a part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">The Odin Project</a> curriculum.
